# Predictive Maintenance
The need to have a way to determine whether or not a particular machine will fail, as well as the nature of the failure, is essential for generation 4.0 industries. The main reason lies behind the following consideration: the repair or replacement of a faulty machine generally requires costs that are much higher than those required for the replacement of a single component. Therefore, the installation of sensors that monitor the state of the machines, collecting the appropriate information, can lead to great savings for industries.

Here we use the AI4I Predictive Maintenance Dataset from the UCI Repository to carry out an analysis that aims to respond to the needs just reported. In particular, the work is presented through a lineup that characterize a typical Machine Learning application. In the first place the dataset is explored to obtain a deeper knowledge that can guide in fully understanding the ground truth. Then, some preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the data for the algorithms we will use to make our predictions. We consider two main tasks: the first consists in establishing whether a generic machine is about to suffer a failure while the second concerns the determination of the nature of the fault. Finally, a comparison is provided between the results obtained by the latter, evaluating both their performance through appropriate metrics, and their interpretability.
